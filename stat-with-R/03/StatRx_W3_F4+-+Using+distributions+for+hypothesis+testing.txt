Let's talk about
how we can use knowledge about distributions
to construct statistical tests. For this purpose
I will talk about the concepts null hypothesis
and p-value. Here
you can see body lengths of a population of Swedish men
with a mean of 182 centimetres
and a standard deviation of seven centimeter.
We assume here that body weight (length?)
is roughly normally distributed.
If you would take random sample from this population,
just one person, it's not so common that you would pick a person
that has exactly the mean height,
182 centimeter. Although
182 centimetres is the most common measurement
there are much more persons
in the interval 170-179 centimeters
So how can we use the knowledge about
the population mean? Imagine
I am the random sample, my height is 190 centimeter.
Our null hypothesis
is that I belong
to the population Swedish men. We can use the knowledge about
the height distribution, the mean,
the standard deviation, and the shape of the curve
to calculate how common it would be
to randomly select a person who is
190 centimetres tall or taller.
This is the area under the curve to the right of 190 centimetres,
and it turns out to be 0.13,
if the total area under the curve
is equal to 1. In fact
we are more interested in measuring just how common it would be to sample
person who deviates 8 centimeter
from the mean, so we would sum up
the area to the right of 190 centimetres
plus the area to the left
of 174 centimetres.
This sums up to 0.26.
Imagine I would sample
100 swedes and I would reject the null hypothesis
each time I get a p-value of 0.02
or smaller. This means that on
average I would make two mistakes
if I do 100 samplings.
What you have seen here
is a very common strategy for constructing
a statistical test using knowledge
about a population.
