The purpose of this video is to get you
up and running with calculating t-tests
in R. You will also get access to
unlimited excercises for interpreting
t-tests. You will be using the function
t.test(), so let's start
by looking at the R documentation page
for the function t.test(). Here are some
important arguments for the function
that are connected to the kind of hypothesis
and alternative hypothesis that is relevant for
your experiment. So we talked
earlier about one-tailed tests.
And the one-tail test
can be defined either
as less or greater.
And a two-tailed test is called
two-sided in this function.
Your t-test can be a group-wise
test, comparing the mean of 
two independent groups. In that case, you have to give the argument
"paired=FALSE".
But your t-test could also
be for a repeated measures
case where one subject has been measured
twice. In this case
you have to set the argument
paired to TRUE. Also pay attention
to the argument equal variants (var.qual). 
So to calculate the classical t-test
you will assume that the variants in the two 
compared groups should be
equal. Then you have to set the argument
var.equal to TRUE.
If the argument var.equal
is set to FALSE,
then you will calculate a special kind
of t-test called the welsh test, 
that compensates for
different variation
in the two groups by calculating
a different
degree of freedom for the test.
Okay, so let's imagine that
you got
the data in some kind of
spreadsheet program. So I will use ctrl + c
to copy the data and we can imagine
that the dataset contains 
weights in kilogram
of persons, and I have named the two groups
A and B. Now we go back and I will use the function
read.table(), setting the argument
to "clipboard" and header=T (true)
So let's try
what will happen if I just throw in
weight into the function
t.test()?
This works but it might not be what you had
wished for so if I just put in
weight into t-test it will calculate the One sample t-test.
So you can see that
from the degrees of freedom 27
that R
considers the 28 measurements to be
one group and the
alternative hypothesis is that
the mean of this group is not
equal to 0 so this is not
exactly what we wished for. Maybe it's more common that you would like to
compare the means of these two
groups. Let's say those
were from two groups of people
who used a different kind of diet.
So here
as argument to t.test I put in
A from weight (weight$A) and B from weight (weight$B). 
Now you can see that
R has calculated the so-called welsh two sample t-test.
It means that
it considers the data to be from
two independent groups. The alternative hypothesis
is that the true difference in
means is
not equal to 0.
R calculates the mean value of
each group and reports this and you can see from the degrees
of freedom that it is a strange number, 25.684.
That's the
compensated degrees of freedom that takes into account
that the variabilitity is different in the two groups.
Probably it's more common
that you would assume the same
variability in the groups that you
compare, so then you would add the argument
var.equal=T (true).
You will get back the result table for a classical
two sample t-test so here the degrees of
freedom is 26, it's
28 measurements minus 1
per group.
And the alternative hypothesis is still that the true difference in mean is not equal to
0.
Here we can see again reported the means of
each group and
the p-value was calculated to be
0.077
if I round it.
So it means that the probability to
draw two samples from the same population
and get
this difference between the means is actually close to
eight percent chance so normally
in this case we would not reject the null hypothesis.
We cannot conclude that these two groups
differ in mean.
But what if this was a different
experiment where the values of A
and B are logically coupled
in pairs? Then we would set
the argument paired=T (true). 
Here you will instead get
reported the mean of the differences
in the pairs of values between
A and B and this mean is
-6.9. Here you can see from
the p-value 0.027
that the probability
that the mean paired differences in
two groups would be 6.9
is quite a bit lower than 5 percent.
So at the 5 percent level
we would here reject the null hypothesis,
and conclude that they seem to be a difference
between the two groups. Maybe it was measurement of weights
before and after some kind of intervention like a diet.
Okay, finally I would like to share with you
the function that I use
to create new t-tests for my examinations.
And this might be useful for you if you would like
to get more exercise to inspect
and interpret the result of t-tests.
So first I will run a number of
lines of code and 
this is actually a new function, so I create a function called
ttest.for.examination.
I fill this new object with a function
and the function takes four arguments: number of subjects or measurements,
the mean value of each group, the standard deviation.
Let's see now what happens if
we run this function.
So I will back up a little bit for you to see
what happens. So after
creating the function
I used the function ttest.for.examination() and I put in
the number of measurements to 13,
the mean of the first group should be 90, the mean of the second group
should be 105.
Quite a large difference. And the standard deviation should be 10.
I get a report back here, a printout of the
arguments that I passed to my function.
I can see the values that have been
randomly created for the two groups.
And now I see first the result table for 
a two sample t-test and a result
table for a paired t-test.
So here in both cases the p-values were
very low, maybe we should try
to create examples with a smaller
difference between the
means. Let's try this.
Let's set the means to 92 and 10 and the standard deviation to
10. And in this case
we get quite high p-values so
the probability to get
the difference 94 to 96.9
is actually almost 50 percent
chance to draw this 
if we draw 2 samples from the same population so here
we cannot reject
our null hypothesis.
So as long as you
run the same command again and again
you will get new
examples where you can compare. You see the
values and you see the result tables
for a two-sample t-test and a paired t-test
for the same set of randomly generated data.
